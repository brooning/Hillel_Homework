   <h2>Congratulations on the arrival of the New Year according to the Chinese calendar!</h2>
   <p>Our long New Year's weekend compared to the Chinese is childish nonsense. By tradition, China celebrates the New Year for more than two weeks. This year, they will celebrate from the evening of January 28 until February 12, the Lantern Festival. The official weekend lasts a week - from January 29 to February 4.</p>
